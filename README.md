# etch-a-sketch

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## What to do

- [ ] Make a 16x16 grid on a pad
- [ ] Make the grids ajustable
- [ ] Make it so that the height and width of the grids on the pad automatically adjust and fit to the width and height of the pad.
- [ ] When the user clicks the grid, change its color.

### Later

- [ ] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- [ ] Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
